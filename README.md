# Description
This is a Wechat applet project about fortune telling. It mainly involves registration, form submission and the process of returning data from API calls and rendering to the page. There are also many skills for flexible use of Vue and the encapsulation process of the whole project. At the same time, Weui components are also used. It is worth learning. If it is helpful to you, please support me with your star. Thank you.
